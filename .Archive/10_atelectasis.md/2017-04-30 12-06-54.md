# atelectasis 肺不张（肺膨胀不全）
## Pathology（英）
 Atelectasis is reduced inflation of all or part of the lung (20). One of the commonest mechanisms is resorption of air distal to airway obstruction (eg, an endobronchial neoplasm) (21). The synonym collapse is often used interchangeably with atelectasis, particularly when it is severe or accompanied by obvious increase in lung opacity.
## 病理（中）
 肺不张是指全肺或部分肺膨胀不良。最常见的机理是气道阻塞后远端的气体被吸收（阻塞原因如，支气管内新生物）。肺萎陷常可作为不张的同义词使用，尤其应用于描述肺透亮度明显降低时。

肺不张的原因有：阻塞-远端气体吸收；外压性；牵拉性（如纤维化）

肺不张大体标本，常常容易与肺淤血混淆。☆所在为正常肺组织。

## Radiographics and CT Scans（英）
 Reduced volume is seen, accompanied by increased opacity (chest radiograph) or attenuation (CT scan) in the affected part of the lung (Fig 8). Atelectasis is often associated with abnormal displacement of fissures, bronchi, vessels, diaphragm, heart, or mediastinum (22). The distribution can be lobar, segmental, or subsegmental. Atelectasis is often qualified by descriptors such as linear, discoid, or platelike. (See also linear atelectasis, rounded atelectasis.)
