# atelectasis 肺不张（肺膨胀不全）
## Pathology（英）
 Atelectasis is reduced inflation of all or part of the lung (20). One of the commonest mechanisms is resorption of air distal to airway obstruction (eg, an endobronchial neoplasm) (21). The synonym collapse is often used interchangeably with atelectasis, particularly when it is severe or accompanied by obvious increase in lung opacity.
