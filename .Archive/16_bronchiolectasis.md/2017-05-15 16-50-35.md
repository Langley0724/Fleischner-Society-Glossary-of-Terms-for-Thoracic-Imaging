# bronchiolectasis细支气管扩张

## Pathology（英）
Bronchiolectasis is defined as dilatation of bronchioles. It is caused by inflammatory airways disease (potentially reversible) or, more frequently, fibrosis.

## 病理（中）
 细支气管扩张症界定为细支气管的扩张。细支气管扩张可由气道炎性病变所致（可以为可逆的）或者更常见由肺纤维化导致。

细支气管扩张大体标本，注意看胸膜下所见细支气管的扩张情况。

Discrete bronchiectasis and diffuse bronchiolectasis were observed on the CT scan 
在CT扫描中，可见散在和弥漫的细支气管扩张。【病例来源：Arch Bronconeumol.2013;49:411-2 - Vol. 49 Num.9 DOI: 10.1016/j.arbr.2013.07.009】
(A and B) An increase in the bronchoalveolar ratio is seen in the high definition CT scan during inspiration and expiration, a radiological sign suggestive of bronchiectasis and diffuse bronchiolectasis. No radiological signs of air trapping are observed. (C) Histological sample obtained from lung biopsy: Masson's trichrome stain; bronchiolar submucosal fibrosis is seen, along with the appearance of small scars. (D) Histological sample obtained from the lung biopsy: hematoxylin–eosin stain: bronchial obliteration can be observed.
图A和B，高分辨CT扫描，深吸气相和深呼气相，支气管肺泡比率增加，这是一个提示支气管扩张和弥漫性细支气管扩张的影像学征象。未见空气潴留征象。图C.肺活检病理，马松三色染色，可见支气管粘膜下纤维化，伴有小疤痕。图D.肺活检标本，苏木精-伊红染色，可见支气管闭塞改变

##  CT scans（英）
When dilated bronchioles are filled with exudate and are thick walled, they are visible as a tree-in-bud pattern or as centrilobular nodules (31,32). In traction bronchiolectasis, the dilated bronchioles are seen as small, cystic, tubular airspaces, associated with CT findings of fibrosis (Fig 12). (See also traction bronchiectasis and traction bronchiolectasis, tree-in-bud pattern.)
