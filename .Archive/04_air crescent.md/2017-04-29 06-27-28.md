       —An air crescent is a collection of air in a crescentic shape thatseparates the wall of a cavity from an inner mass (Fig 3). The air crescentsign is often considered characteristic of either Aspergillus colonization ofpre-existing cavities or retraction of infarcted lung in angioinvasive aspergillosis(9,10). However, the air crescent sign has also been reported in other conditions,including tuberculosis, Wegener granulomatosis, intracavitary hemorrhage, andlung cancer. (See also mycetoma.)
