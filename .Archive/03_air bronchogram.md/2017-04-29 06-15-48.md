       —An air bronchogram is a pattern of air-filled (low-attenuation)bronchi on a background of opaque (high-attenuation) airless lung . The sign implies (a) patency of proximal airways and (b) evacuation of alveolar airby means of absorption (atelectasis) or replacement (eg, pneumonia) or acombination of these processes. In rare cases, the displacement of air is the result of marked interstitial expansion (eg, lymphoma) (8).
